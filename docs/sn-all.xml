Although these damaging attacks are often used to extort high-profile gaming and gambling sites before major gambling events, attacks are also launched against individual users who do something to annoy &#34;zombie fleet masters&#34; while they are online.

      <description>Leo and I discuss the use of SSL and SSH encrypted tunneling for providing privacy and security whenever an insecure local network is being used - such as at an open WiFi hotspot or when using a hotel&#39;s network.  These solutions are not transparent and tend to be configuration intensive.  They also require the use of a &#34;server&#34; of some sort at the user&#39;s home or office.  This makes these approaches less suitable for casual users, but offers a solution for the more technically inclined road warriors.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-015.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-015.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>Leo and Steve discuss the design, operation, and complete lack of security of Ethernet - the LAN technology that virtually all of the world uses.  They explain how this lack of security enables a wide range of serious attacks to be perpetrated by any other machine sharing the same Ethernet - such as in a wireless hotspot, within a corporate network, or even in a wired hotel where the entire hotel is one big exploitable Ethernet LAN.  GRC&#39;s ARP Cache Poisoning page contains a detailed explanation of these problems with diagrams and links to readily available Ethernet ARP exploitation malware.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-029.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-029.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>Steve and Leo conclude their multi-week coverage of the fundamental technologies underlying modern cryptographic systems. They discuss the number of 512-bit primes (two of which are used to form 1024-bit public keys) and the relative difficulty of performing prime factorizations at various bit lengths. They discuss the importance of, and solutions to, private key recovery using varying numbers of trustees; and conclude by explaining the need for, and the operation of, security certificates.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-037.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-037.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>Steve and Leo discuss the broad topic of web browser security.  They examine the implications of running &#34;client-side&#34; code in the form of interpreted scripting languages such as Java, JavaScript, and VBScript, and also the native object code contained within browser &#34;plug-ins&#34;including Microsofts ActiveX.  Steve outlines the &#34;zone-based&#34; security model used by IE and explains how he surfs with high security under IE, only &#34;lowering his shields&#34; to a website after hes had the chance to look around and decide that the site is trustworthy.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-038.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-038.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>Steve and Leo discuss an aspect of the &#34;cost&#34; of using the Internet - a packetized global network which (only) offers &#34;best effort&#34; packet delivery service.  Since &#34;capacity&#34; is the cost, not per-packet usage, the cost is the same whether the network is used or not.

      <description>To understand the advances made during 50 years of computer evolution, we need to understand computers 50 years ago.  In this first installment of a new Security Now! series, we design a 50-year-old computer.  In future weeks, we will trace the factors that shaped their design during the four decades that followed.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-233.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-233.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>Not surprisingly, the previous week consisted of nearly a single story:  Heartbleed.  It was only &#34;nearly,&#34; though, because we also received the results from the first phase of the TrueCrypt audit.  So this week Leo and I discuss these two topics in detail.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-451.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-451.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>Leo and I discuss the recent Pwn2Own hacking competition.  We examine another serious breach of the Internet&#39;s certificate trust system and marvel at a very clever hack to crack the iPhone four-digit PIN lock.  Then we take a close look at the evolution of booting from BIOS to UEFI and how Microsoft has leveraged this into their &#34;Windows Secure Boot&#34; system.

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Leo and I discuss the recent Pwn2Own hacking competition.  We examine another serious breach of the Internet's certificate trust system and marvel at a very clever hack to crack the iPhone four-digit PIN lock.  Then we take a close look at the evolution of booting from BIOS to UEFI and how Microsoft has leveraged this into their "Windows Secure Boot" system.  We also examine what it might mean for the future of non-Windows operating systems.

      <description>Leo and I catch up with the week&#39;s major security events.  We then examine the ecosystem of web page advertising by comparing it to other &#34;opportunistic advertising&#34; such as that appearing on public transportation, highway billboards, broadcast television commercials and other public venues - which consumers have no obligation to consume.  I eschew the implication that visitors to a web page have an obligation to retrieve third-party content, over which the website has little or no control, which consumes bandwidth, reduces online privacy, hinders performance, and potentially exposes visitors to malicious exploitation.  And I believe this remains true even when a visitor&#39;s retrieval of such despicable third-party content would generate much-needed revenue for the visited site.  Finally, I review the many operational features of uBlock Origin, my chosen HTML firewall, which effectively returns control to web users.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-523.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-523.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week, Leo and I catch up with the past week&#39;s news.  Did Microsoft lose control of its secure boot Golden Key?  We discuss AdBlock, unblock, counter-unblock, and that counter-counter-unblock is well underway.  Leo tells a story from the field about Avast A/V.  A &#34;security is hard to do&#34; mistake is found in an update to the Internet&#39;s TCP protocol.  We talk about Microsoft&#39;s evolving Windows Update policies, an ber-cool way for developers to decrypt and inspect their Firefox and Chrome local TLS traffic, a nice write-up of our &#34;three dumb routers&#34; solution, trouble with Windows Identity leak mitigation, yet another way of exfiltrating data from an air-gapped PC, and some fun miscellany.

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Leo and I discuss some serious concerns raised over compelled biometric authentication, then do a detailed dive into the recently completed audit of VeraCrypt, the successor to TrueCrypt.  We've got more on web browsers fatiguing system main SSD storage and a bunch of interesting miscellany, including a question asked of Elon Musk:  "Are we living within a simulated reality?"  We conclude with 11 questions and observations from our terrific listeners.

      <description>Leo and I discuss last week&#39;s major attack on DNS, answering the question of whether or not the Internet is still working.  We look at Linux&#39;s worrisome &#34;Dirty COW&#34; bug, rediscovered in the kernel after nine years.  We address the worrisome average lifetime of Linux bugs; share a bit of errata and miscellany; and offer an in-depth analysis of Drammer, the new, largely unpatchable, Android mobile device Rowhammer 30-second exploit.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-583.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-583.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

Google is about to add native ad-blocking to Chrome - and what exactly are abusive ads?  MasterCard&#39;s building a questionable fingerprint sensor into their cards.  Are Bose headphones spying on their listeners?  Ten worrisome security holes are discovered in Linksys routers.  MIT cashes out half of its IPv4 space.

We also look at what the large Stack Overflow site had to do to do HTTPS, the WiFi security of various properties owned by the U.S. President, more worrisome news coming from the U.K.&#39;s Theresa May, the still sorry state of certificate revocation, are SSDs also subject to Rowhammer-like attacks, some miscellany, and closing the loop with our listeners.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-613.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-613.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we have a Marcus Hutchins update and the back story on the NIST&#39;s rewrite of their 15-year-old password guidance.  Can DNA be used to hack a computer?  Can stop sign graffiti be used to misdirect autonomous vehicles?  We discuss the final nail in the WoSign/StartCom coffin, why we need global Internet policy treaties, this week in Researchers Need Protection, a VPN provider who is doing everything right, ElcomSoft&#39;s password manager cracker, a bit of errata and miscellany, and some closing-the-loop feedback from this podcast&#39;s terrific listeners.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-624.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-624.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>Although there are an unbelievable FIVE Sharknado movies, this will be the first and last time we use that title for a podcast!  This week we have another update on Marcus Hutchins.  We discuss the validity of WikiLeaks documents, the feasibility of rigorously proving software correctness, and the fact that nearly half a million people need to get their bodies&#39; firmware updated.  Another controversial CIA project is exposed by WikiLeaks.  A careful analysis is done of the FCC&#39;s Title II Net Neutrality public comments.  We talk about a neat two-factor auth tracking site, the Stupid Patent of the Month, an example of a vanity top-level domain, a bit of errata, and finish up with the utterly unconscionable security mistakes made by AT&amp;T in their line of U-Verse routers.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-627.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-627.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[This week we examine still another new Spectre processor speculation attack.  We look at the new "Death Botnet," the security of the U.S. DOD websites, lots of Google Chrome news, pushes by the U.S. Senate toward more security, the emergence and threat of clone websites in other TLDs, more cryptocurrency mining bans, and Google's Titan hardware security dongles.  We finish by examining the recently discovered flaw in the Bluetooth protocol which has device manufacturers and OS makers scrambling - but do they really need to?

      <description>This week we discuss yet another new and diabolical router hack and attack, Reddit&#39;s discovery of SMS 2FA failure, WannaCry refusing to die, law enforcement&#39;s ample unused forensic resources, a new and very clever BGP-based attack, Windows 10 update dissatisfaction, and Google advancing their state-sponsored attack notifications.  We ask, &#34;What is Google&#39;s Project Dragonfly?&#34;  We go over a highly effective and highly targeted ransomware campaign, present some closing-the-loop feedback from our listeners, and reveal a breakthrough in hacking/attacking WiFi passwords.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-675.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-675.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we examine and explore an October Windows Surprise of a different sort.  A security researcher massively weaponizes the existing MicroTik vulnerability and releases it as a proof of concept.

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[This week we examine and explore an October Windows Surprise of a different sort.  A security researcher massively weaponizes the existing MicroTik vulnerability and releases it as a proof of concept.  Israel's National Cybersecurity Authority warns about a clever voicemail WhatsApp OTP bypass.  What DID happen with that recent Google+ breach?  Google tightens up its Chrome Extensions security policies.  WiFi radio protocol designations finally switch to simple version numbering.  Intel unwraps its 9th-generation Core processors.  We've got head-spinning PDF updates from Adobe and Foxit.  This isn't a competition, guys!  And, finally, we take a look at the danger of Supply Chain Attacks, with a possible real-world example.

      <description>This week a widely used embedded OS (FreeRTOS) is in the doghouse, as are at least eight D-Link routers which have serious problems, most of which D-Link has stated will never be patched.  We look at five new problems in Drupal 7 and 8, two of which are rated critical; trouble with Live Networks RTSP streaming server; still more trouble with the now-infamous Windows 10 Build 1809 feature update; and a longstanding zero-day in the widely used and most popular plugin for jQuery.  We then discuss what can only be described as an embarrassing mistake in the open source libssh library, concluding by examining a fun recent hack and posing its solution to our audience as our Security Now!

      <description>This week we cover last month&#39;s Patch Tuesday this month.  We look at a GDPR-inspired lawsuit filed by Privacy International.  We ask our listeners to check two router ports to protect against a new botnet that&#39;s making the rounds.  We look at another irresponsibly disclosed zero-day, this time in VirtualBox.  We look at CloudFlare&#39;s release of a very cool 1.1.1.1 app for iOS and Android.  And, in perfect synchrony with this week&#39;s main topic, we note Microsoft&#39;s caution about the in-RAM vulnerabilities of the BitLocker whole-drive encryption. We also cover a bit of miscellany, we close the loop with our listeners, and then we take a deep dive into last week&#39;s worrisome revelation about the lack of true security being offered by today&#39;s Self-Encrypting SSD Drives.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-689.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-689.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

We cover the expected takeover of exposed Docker-offering servers.  We note the recently announced successor to recently ratified HTTP/2.  We cover a piece of 1.1.1.1 errata, close the loop with some of our podcast listeners, then finish by considering the future of passwords using a thoughtful article written by Troy Hunt, a well-known Internet security figure and the creator of the popular HaveIBeenPwned web service, among others.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-690.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-690.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

We also have some interesting post-Troy Hunt &#34;Are Passwords Immortal?&#34; listener feedback from last week&#39;s topic.

We also need to mention our prolific zero-day dropper SandboxEscaper, a new effort by the U.S. government to educate industry about the risks of cyberattacks, some welcome news on the ransomware front, some VERY welcome news of a new Windows 10 feature, and a note about a just-published side-channel attack on OS page caches.

      <description>This week we look at the mess arising from Mozilla&#39;s intermediate certificate expiration (the most tweeted event in my feed in a LONG time!), Google&#39;s announcement of self-expiring data retention, another wrinkle in the exploit marketplace, Mozilla&#39;s announcement about deliberate code obfuscation, a hacker who hacked at least 29 other botnet hackers, a warning about a very popular D-Link netcam, who&#39;s paying and who&#39;s receiving bug bounties by country, another user-agent gotcha with Google Docs, a problem with Google Earth on the new Chromium Edge browser, and a bit more about Edge&#39;s future just dropped at the start of Microsoft&#39;s Build 2019 conference.

      <description>As expected after last week&#39;s Tuesday morning end-of-embargo on details of the next round of Intel processor information leakage problems, we will take a closer look at the new challenges they create and the impact of their remediation on system performance and stability.  But before that we look at last Tuesday&#39;s patches from Microsoft, Adobe, and Apple.  We examine a new big security problem for Cisco that even has stock analysts taking notice.  We check in on the ongoing troubles with the cryptocurrency market, see what Johns Hopkins associate professor Matthew Green tweeted about the trouble with Google&#39;s Titan Bluetooth dongle, and deal with yet another monthly problem with Windows 10 updates.  We touch on a bit of miscellany, then wrap up with a look at the new so-called Microarchitectural Data Sampling vulnerabilities.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-715.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-715.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we primarily focus upon the almost certainly impending doom of the Internet, as the Windows Remote Desktop Protocol saga finishes out its second week with a great deal of news and new evidence-based expectation for the end of humanity as we have known it.  Okay, well, maybe it won&#39;t be quite that dramatic, but it already makes last year&#39;s Meltdown and Spectre flaws seem quaint.  But before we get to that, we take a look at the FIVE new zero-day exploits just dropped by SandboxEscaper, Google&#39;s discovery and confession of 14 years of cleartext password storage, Microsoft&#39;s just-released Win10 Feature Update 1903, Firefox&#39;s release 67, and some interesting new data about the prevalence of validly signed malware.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-716.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-716.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we check in on the BlueKeep RDP vulnerability.  We look at the planned shutdown of one of the, if not THE, most successful, if one can call it that, affiliate-based ransomware systems.  We update you on the anti-robocalling problem and then look at the recent announcements by the Russian and Chinese militaries about their plans to move away from the Microsoft Windows OS.  We also look at Apple&#39;s announcement yesterday of their forthcoming &#34;Sign in with Apple&#34; service, touch on the state of SQRL, and then share a bit of fun feedback from a listener.  We finish by examining the interesting details behind a significant old-school persistent campaign, the Nansh0u campaign, apparently sourced from China, which has successfully compromised many tens of thousands of servers exposed to the Internet.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-717.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-717.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we catch up with the continuing antics of SandboxEscaper.  We give an update on the status of the still-not-yet-widely-exploited BlueKeep vulnerability, and also look at a new botnet which is pounding on RDP servers (but not yet using BlueKeep).  The FBI has issued an interesting advisory about not trusting secure sites just because they&#39;re secure, so we&#39;ll examine that.  The popular VideoLAN player receives an important update thanks to an interesting source, Microsoft&#39;s Edge browser takes another step forward, and Mozilla reorganizes a bit.  Then I&#39;m going to share my must-have Utility of the Week, a just-released sci-fi movie on Netflix, and a bit of closing-the-loop feedback from the Twitterverse which resulted from my, as planned, first formal full release of SQRL.  We&#39;ll close with a look at the critical need for anyone running the Exim mail server to update immediately.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-718.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-718.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we check in on the state of last week&#39;s Linux TCP SACK kernel panic, examine two Mozilla zero-days which were being used against Coinbase and others, and note that performing a full factory reset of an IoT device may not be sufficient.  We look at a very clever and elegant solution to OpenSSH key theft via Rowhammer attacks, share an update on the BlueKeep RDP vulnerability, and examine the cause of a three-hour widespread Internet outage yesterday morning.  We discuss NASA&#39;s APT, which crawled in via a Raspberry Pi, the cost of paying versus not paying a ransomware ransom, and an update on Microsoft&#39;s Chromium-based Edge browser.

      <description>This week we stumble over a number of instances where technology appears to be colliding with the status quo.  In any complex social system, individual and group interests are often complex and may be in opposition.  So when new technology comes along to offer new capabilities, not everyone is going to be pleased.  So this week we discuss some of the mounting tensions being created by connectivity, storage, and computation which are being combined to create many new capabilities.

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[This week we stumble over a number of instances where technology appears to be colliding with the status quo.  In any complex social system, individual and group interests are often complex and may be in opposition.  So when new technology comes along to offer new capabilities, not everyone is going to be pleased.  So this week we discuss some of the mounting tensions being created by connectivity, storage, and computation which are being combined to create many new capabilities.  We look at the surprising backlash to Mozilla's privacy-enhancing DNS-over-HTTPS support, concerns over the use of facial recognition and automobile license plate scanners, and the future of satellite-based Internet services.  We present some SQRL news and share a bunch of closing-the-loop feedback from our listeners.  We then examine how a Ruby code repository was hacked and look at the U.K. GCHQ's proposal for adding "ghost" participants into private conversations.

      <description>This week we cover a few bullet points from last Tuesday&#39;s monthly Windows patches, as well as some annoyance that the patches caused for Windows 7 users.  We track some interesting ongoing ransomware news and look at the mixed blessing of fining companies for self-reporting breaches.  We check out a survey of enterprise malware headaches, update some Mozilla/Firefox news, and examine yet another (and kind of obvious) way of exfiltrating information from a PC.  We address a bit of errata, some miscellany, and closing-the-loop feedback with our listeners.  We then conclude with a closer look at all the progress that&#39;s been occurring quietly with DNS encryption.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-723.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-723.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we start off with something bad that we unfortunately saw coming.  We then look at the changing security indication feedback in browsers; the challenge of keeping browsers compatible with important but non-standards-compliant websites; the failure and repair of incognito browsing mode; the possibility of a forthcoming &#34;super incognito mode&#34; for Firefox; a new super-fast TLS stack written in the Rust programming language; Microsoft&#39;s promised open source release of their voting machine election software; and yet another widely deployed, exposed, and exploitable Internet server.  We have a quick bit of miscellany and some terrific SQRL news.  Then we look at a recent and quite sobering report from Sophos about attacks on exposed RDP servers.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-724.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-724.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

We look again at Tavis Ormandy&#39;s discovery of the secret undocumented CTF protocol, wondering WTF is CTF?  We note a new and devastating strategy in the ransomware battle which hit Texas last Friday.  We also have the sad demise of Extended Validation certificates, the further removal of FTP support from web browsers, Google&#39;s campaign to still further reduce web certificate lifetimes, and Netflix&#39;s discovery of eight implementation flaws in the new HTTP/2 protocol.  We&#39;ll cover a bit of miscellany, update on my file syncing journey, touch on SQRL news and SpinRite, then conclude with a look at the most recent attack on Bluetooth pairing negotiation which renders all Bluetooth associations vulnerable to a trivial attack.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-728.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-728.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

We note a troubling increase in attacks on the open source software supply chain.  Google&#39;s announced plans to add data breach notification to Chrome.  We look at a surprising Apple iOS v12.4 regression (whoops!) and at another Microsoft RDP component in need of updating.  I update our listeners on the state of SQRL (another of its documents is completed) and on SQRL presentations past and future.  I share some news from my ongoing file sync journey.
