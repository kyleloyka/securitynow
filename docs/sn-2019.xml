      <description>This week we look at the NSA&#39;s announced forthcoming release of an internal powerful reverse engineering tool for examining and understanding other people&#39;s code; emergency out-of-cycle patches from both Adobe and Microsoft; and, yes, we do need to mention PewDiePie again.  We also need to mention our prolific zero-day dropper SandboxEscaper, a new effort by the U.S. government to educate industry about the risks of cyberattacks, some welcome news on the ransomware front, some VERY welcome news of a new Windows 10 feature, and a note about a just-published side-channel attack on OS page caches.  Then we&#39;ll wrap with an update on my work on SQRL and my discovery of a VERY impressive and free large file transmission and sharing facility.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-696.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-696.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we discuss a number of ongoing out-in-the-wild attacks, along with a bunch of other news.  We have another early-warned Drupal vulnerability that has immediately come under attack in the wild, and a 19-year-old flaw in an obscure decompress for the &#34;ACE&#34; archive format, which until a few days ago WinRAR was supporting to its detriment.  Microsoft reveals an abuse of HTTP/2 protocol which is DoSing its IIS servers.  Mozilla faces a dilemma about a wannabe Certificate Authority, and they also send a worried letter to Australia.  Microsoft&#39;s Edge browser is revealed to be secretly whitelisting 58 web domains which are allowed to bypass its &#34;Click-to-Run&#34; permission for FLASH.

      <description>This week we look back at last week&#39;s March Patch Madness.  We have an answer about the Win7 SHA-256 Windows Update Update; big news regarding the many attacks leveraging the recently discovered WinRAR vulnerability; what happens when Apple, Google, and GoDaddy all drop a bit; an update on a big recent jump in Mirai Botnet capability; some worrisome news about compromised Counter Strike gaming servers; some welcome privacy enhancements coming in the next Android Q; a pair of very odd web browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox from Microsoft; a bit of follow-up on last week&#39;s Spoiler topic; some closing-the-loop feedback from our terrific listeners; and an early look at a VERY exciting and encouraging project to create an entirely open eVoting system.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-706.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-706.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

We finally know the source of the AV troubles with the April Patch Tuesday updates.  We look at the NIST&#39;s formal fuzzing development, consider the source of a massive and ongoing database data leak involving more than half of all American households, note that Windows Insiders are already finding that their systems won&#39;t update to the May 2019 feature update, and address the concerns of United Airlines passengers who have noticed and been understandably upset by seatback cameras pointing at them.

      <description>As expected after last week&#39;s Tuesday morning end-of-embargo on details of the next round of Intel processor information leakage problems, we will take a closer look at the new challenges they create and the impact of their remediation on system performance and stability.  But before that we look at last Tuesday&#39;s patches from Microsoft, Adobe, and Apple.  We examine a new big security problem for Cisco that even has stock analysts taking notice.  We check in on the ongoing troubles with the cryptocurrency market, see what Johns Hopkins associate professor Matthew Green tweeted about the trouble with Google&#39;s Titan Bluetooth dongle, and deal with yet another monthly problem with Windows 10 updates.  We touch on a bit of miscellany, then wrap up with a look at the new so-called Microarchitectural Data Sampling vulnerabilities.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-715.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-715.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we primarily focus upon the almost certainly impending doom of the Internet, as the Windows Remote Desktop Protocol saga finishes out its second week with a great deal of news and new evidence-based expectation for the end of humanity as we have known it.  Okay, well, maybe it won&#39;t be quite that dramatic, but it already makes last year&#39;s Meltdown and Spectre flaws seem quaint.  But before we get to that, we take a look at the FIVE new zero-day exploits just dropped by SandboxEscaper, Google&#39;s discovery and confession of 14 years of cleartext password storage, Microsoft&#39;s just-released Win10 Feature Update 1903, Firefox&#39;s release 67, and some interesting new data about the prevalence of validly signed malware.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-716.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-716.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we check in on the BlueKeep RDP vulnerability.  We look at the planned shutdown of one of the, if not THE, most successful, if one can call it that, affiliate-based ransomware systems.  We update you on the anti-robocalling problem and then look at the recent announcements by the Russian and Chinese militaries about their plans to move away from the Microsoft Windows OS.  We also look at Apple&#39;s announcement yesterday of their forthcoming &#34;Sign in with Apple&#34; service, touch on the state of SQRL, and then share a bit of fun feedback from a listener.  We finish by examining the interesting details behind a significant old-school persistent campaign, the Nansh0u campaign, apparently sourced from China, which has successfully compromised many tens of thousands of servers exposed to the Internet.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-717.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-717.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>
