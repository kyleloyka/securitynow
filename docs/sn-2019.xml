      <description>This week we look at the NSA&#39;s announced forthcoming release of an internal powerful reverse engineering tool for examining and understanding other people&#39;s code; emergency out-of-cycle patches from both Adobe and Microsoft; and, yes, we do need to mention PewDiePie again.  We also need to mention our prolific zero-day dropper SandboxEscaper, a new effort by the U.S. government to educate industry about the risks of cyberattacks, some welcome news on the ransomware front, some VERY welcome news of a new Windows 10 feature, and a note about a just-published side-channel attack on OS page caches.  Then we&#39;ll wrap with an update on my work on SQRL and my discovery of a VERY impressive and free large file transmission and sharing facility.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-696.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-696.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-696-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we look at more privacy fallout from our recent coverage of Facebook and Google.  We examine the uptake rate of recent Windows 10 feature releases.

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[This week we look at more privacy fallout from our recent coverage of Facebook and Google.  We examine the uptake rate of recent Windows 10 feature releases.  We finally know the source of the AV troubles with the April Patch Tuesday updates.  We look at the NIST's formal fuzzing development, consider the source of a massive and ongoing database data leak involving more than half of all American households, note that Windows Insiders are already finding that their systems won't update to the May 2019 feature update, and address the concerns of United Airlines passengers who have noticed and been understandably upset by seatback cameras pointing at them.  Finally, we have the "Cranky Old Guy Tip of the Week," touch on a bit of miscellany, then take a look at what many in the security industry are watching with concern:  the large and emerging threat of website credential stuffing attacks.

      <description>This week we look at the mess arising from Mozilla&#39;s intermediate certificate expiration (the most tweeted event in my feed in a LONG time!), Google&#39;s announcement of self-expiring data retention, another wrinkle in the exploit marketplace, Mozilla&#39;s announcement about deliberate code obfuscation, a hacker who hacked at least 29 other botnet hackers, a warning about a very popular D-Link netcam, who&#39;s paying and who&#39;s receiving bug bounties by country, another user-agent gotcha with Google Docs, a problem with Google Earth on the new Chromium Edge browser, and a bit more about Edge&#39;s future just dropped at the start of Microsoft&#39;s Build 2019 conference.

      <description>As expected after last week&#39;s Tuesday morning end-of-embargo on details of the next round of Intel processor information leakage problems, we will take a closer look at the new challenges they create and the impact of their remediation on system performance and stability.  But before that we look at last Tuesday&#39;s patches from Microsoft, Adobe, and Apple.  We examine a new big security problem for Cisco that even has stock analysts taking notice.  We check in on the ongoing troubles with the cryptocurrency market, see what Johns Hopkins associate professor Matthew Green tweeted about the trouble with Google&#39;s Titan Bluetooth dongle, and deal with yet another monthly problem with Windows 10 updates.  We touch on a bit of miscellany, then wrap up with a look at the new so-called Microarchitectural Data Sampling vulnerabilities.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-715.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-715.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-715-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we primarily focus upon the almost certainly impending doom of the Internet, as the Windows Remote Desktop Protocol saga finishes out its second week with a great deal of news and new evidence-based expectation for the end of humanity as we have known it.  Okay, well, maybe it won&#39;t be quite that dramatic, but it already makes last year&#39;s Meltdown and Spectre flaws seem quaint.  But before we get to that, we take a look at the FIVE new zero-day exploits just dropped by SandboxEscaper, Google&#39;s discovery and confession of 14 years of cleartext password storage, Microsoft&#39;s just-released Win10 Feature Update 1903, Firefox&#39;s release 67, and some interesting new data about the prevalence of validly signed malware.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-716.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-716.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-716-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we check in on the BlueKeep RDP vulnerability.  We look at the planned shutdown of one of the, if not THE, most successful, if one can call it that, affiliate-based ransomware systems.

We also look at Apple&#39;s announcement yesterday of their forthcoming &#34;Sign in with Apple&#34; service, touch on the state of SQRL, and then share a bit of fun feedback from a listener.  We finish by examining the interesting details behind a significant old-school persistent campaign, the Nansh0u campaign, apparently sourced from China, which has successfully compromised many tens of thousands of servers exposed to the Internet.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-717.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-717.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-717-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we catch up with the continuing antics of SandboxEscaper.  We give an update on the status of the still-not-yet-widely-exploited BlueKeep vulnerability, and also look at a new botnet which is pounding on RDP servers (but not yet using BlueKeep).  The FBI has issued an interesting advisory about not trusting secure sites just because they&#39;re secure, so we&#39;ll examine that.  The popular VideoLAN player receives an important update thanks to an interesting source, Microsoft&#39;s Edge browser takes another step forward, and Mozilla reorganizes a bit.  Then I&#39;m going to share my must-have Utility of the Week, a just-released sci-fi movie on Netflix, and a bit of closing-the-loop feedback from the Twitterverse which resulted from my, as planned, first formal full release of SQRL.  We&#39;ll close with a look at the critical need for anyone running the Exim mail server to update immediately.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-718.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-718.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-718-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we check in on the state of last week&#39;s Linux TCP SACK kernel panic, examine two Mozilla zero-days which were being used against Coinbase and others, and note that performing a full factory reset of an IoT device may not be sufficient.

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[This week we check in on the state of last week's Linux TCP SACK kernel panic, examine two Mozilla zero-days which were being used against Coinbase and others, and note that performing a full factory reset of an IoT device may not be sufficient.

      <description>This week we track further occurrences of ransomware in Florida and elsewhere.  We check in on the state of the &#34;going dark&#34; anti-encryption debate.

In the third example of this just this week, we discover a prolific Chinese IoT manufacturer who is logging more than a million of their customers&#39; devices into an exposed database of two-billion-plus records - which returns us to the dilemma we have with the utter lack of oversight and control over our own IoT devices, and the need to soberly reconsider what &#34;IoT&#34; stands for.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-721.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-721.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-721-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we stumble over a number of instances where technology appears to be colliding with the status quo.  In any complex social system, individual and group interests are often complex and may be in opposition.  So when new technology comes along to offer new capabilities, not everyone is going to be pleased.  So this week we discuss some of the mounting tensions being created by connectivity, storage, and computation which are being combined to create many new capabilities.  We look at the surprising backlash to Mozilla&#39;s privacy-enhancing DNS-over-HTTPS support, concerns over the use of facial recognition and automobile license plate scanners, and the future of satellite-based Internet services.  We present some SQRL news and share a bunch of closing-the-loop feedback from our listeners.  We then examine how a Ruby code repository was hacked and look at the U.K. GCHQ&#39;s proposal for adding &#34;ghost&#34; participants into private conversations.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-722.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-722.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-722-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

We track some interesting ongoing ransomware news and look at the mixed blessing of fining companies for self-reporting breaches.

We look again at Tavis Ormandy&#39;s discovery of the secret undocumented CTF protocol, wondering WTF is CTF?  We note a new and devastating strategy in the ransomware battle which hit Texas last Friday.  We also have the sad demise of Extended Validation certificates, the further removal of FTP support from web browsers, Google&#39;s campaign to still further reduce web certificate lifetimes, and Netflix&#39;s discovery of eight implementation flaws in the new HTTP/2 protocol.  We&#39;ll cover a bit of miscellany, update on my file syncing journey, touch on SQRL news and SpinRite, then conclude with a look at the most recent attack on Bluetooth pairing negotiation which renders all Bluetooth associations vulnerable to a trivial attack.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-728.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-728.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-728-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

We'll cover a bit of miscellany, update on my file syncing journey, touch on SQRL news and SpinRite, then conclude with a look at the most recent attack on Bluetooth pairing negotiation which renders all Bluetooth associations vulnerable to a trivial attack.

      <description>This week we check in on Texas, and on the Kazakhstan government&#39;s attempt to be their own CA.  How did that work out for them?  We note a troubling increase in attacks on the open source software supply chain.  Google&#39;s announced plans to add data breach notification to Chrome.  We look at a surprising Apple iOS v12.4 regression (whoops!) and at another Microsoft RDP component in need of updating.  I update our listeners on the state of SQRL (another of its documents is completed) and on SQRL presentations past and future.  I share some news from my ongoing file sync journey.  We conclude by looking at some very interesting and promising moves as browser-based advertising matures from the ad hoc mess it has always been into a privacy-respecting Internet citizen.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-729.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-729.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-729-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we check in on the frenzy to turn CheckM8 into a consumer-friendly iOS jailbreak, on another instance of stealth steganography, on a number of changes to Firefox&#39;s URL display, and on the state of Microsoft&#39;s ElectionGuard open source voting system.

We discuss a recent court ruling regarding U.S. border entry device searches.  We cover yet another bad WhatsApp remote code execution vulnerability.  We examine the impact of version 2 of ZombieLoad, the formation of the Bytecode Alliance, and a bit of media miscellany.

      <description>This week we stumble into Microsoft&#39;s own confusion about whether or not Microsoft&#39;s Security Essentials will continue receiving updates after January 14th.  We look briefly at the year when ransomware happened.  We revisit the Avast and AVG Mozilla extensions to see how they&#39;re doing.  We look at the just-announced big news for Apple&#39;s and Google&#39;s bug bounty programs for 2020, and also at Mozilla&#39;s addition of another very appealing DoH provider (which Leo apparently likes).  We provide a nudge to Drupal site masters to update their Drupal Cores RIGHT NOW.  And then we conclude by revisiting this past decade - spanning 2010 to 2019 - and the many hacks we&#39;ve explored during these previous 10 years.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-746.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-746.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-746-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>
