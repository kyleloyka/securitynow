      <description>Although there are an unbelievable FIVE Sharknado movies, this will be the first and last time we use that title for a podcast!  This week we have another update on Marcus Hutchins.  We discuss the validity of WikiLeaks documents, the feasibility of rigorously proving software correctness, and the fact that nearly half a million people need to get their bodies&#39; firmware updated.  Another controversial CIA project is exposed by WikiLeaks.  A careful analysis is done of the FCC&#39;s Title II Net Neutrality public comments.  We talk about a neat two-factor auth tracking site, the Stupid Patent of the Month, an example of a vanity top-level domain, a bit of errata, and finish up with the utterly unconscionable security mistakes made by AT&amp;T in their line of U-Verse routers.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-627.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-627.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-627-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>
