      <description>Leo and I discuss the continuing woes of WoSign.  Autonomous micro-recon drones turn out to be real.  A new crypto attack on short block ciphers prompts immediate changes in OpenVPN and OpenSSL.  We introduce a new Security Now! Abbreviation, &#34;YAWTTY,&#34; Yet Another Way To Track You.  We continue with discouraging social engineering experiment, another clever USB attack, a bunch of fun miscellany, and a look at the weaponizing of Rowhammer with &#34;Flip Feng Shui,&#34; the most incredibly righteous and sublime hack ever, ending with our  follow-up to last week&#39;s Security Now!

      <description>This week, Leo and I discuss ticket-buying bots getting their hands slapped (do they have hands?); a truly nasty new addition to encrypting ransomware operation; a really dumb old problem returning to many recent Netgear routers; Yahoo being too pleased with their bug bounty program; and steganometric advertising malware that went undetected for two years.  uBlock Origin readies for a big new platform.  What exactly is the BitDefender BOX?  We wish we knew!  VeraCrypt was audited; next up OpenVPN, yay!  We have the definitive answer to the question of where Spock&#39;s thumb should be; Steve&#39;s new relaxing and endless puzzler; and, finally, questions from our listeners.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-590.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-590.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>
