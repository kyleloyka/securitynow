      <description>This first podcast of 2020 we look at a proposed standard for creating machine-readable warrant canaries.  We also take a precautionary lesson from a big Xiaomi blunder, examine Microsoft&#39;s research into brute forcing RDP, look at the continuing problem at the point of sale, follow up on Russia&#39;s plan to disconnect from the Internet, consider the end of life of Python 2.7, review the top 20 HackerOne bounty payers, warn of some bad new SQLite security vulnerabilities, and cover a bit of sci-fi, SQRL, and SpinRite miscellany.  Then we group all malware into a seven-member lexicon and quickly run through each one.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-748.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-748.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-748-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Jason Howell</description>

      <description>This week&#39;s Security Now! podcast is titled &#34;Windows 7 - R.I.P.,&#34; not because there&#39;s much that we haven&#39;t already said about the fact, but that it happens TODAY; and that, given the still massive install base of Windows 7, it&#39;s significant that all of those machines will now be going without any clearly needed security updates.  So the big news for this week WAS to be the event of the first successful preimage attack on the SHA-1 hash.  But that news was preempted at the last minute by the much more immediately significant news of the remotely exploitable &#34;Cable Haunt&#34; vulnerability that&#39;s present in most of the world&#39;s cable modems right now!  So we&#39;ll be talking about that after we look at the FBI&#39;s recent request to have Apple unlock another terrorist&#39;s iPhone; update on the Checkrain jailbreak solution; examine the challenge of checking for illegal images while preserving privacy; look at some deeply worrying research into just how easy it is for bad guys to get SIMs swapped; examine the consequences of not patching a bad VPN flaw; deal with a bit of miscellany; and then, finally, look at the new &#34;Cable Haunt&#34; vulnerability.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-749.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-749.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-749-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

We also cover a Microsoft cloud database mistake, some interesting legislation under consideration in New York, new attacks against a consumer router firmware, a rise of new attacks against our browsers, a welcome new publication from NIST on Privacy, a massive leakage of telnet usernames and passwords, a welcome micropatch for this month&#39;s IE zero-day, a bit of miscellany and SpinRite news, and then some coverage of the final nail that was recently pounded into SHA-1&#39;s coffin.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-751.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-751.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-751-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we examine the most recent flaw found in Intel&#39;s processors and what it means.  We look at the continually moving target that is Windows 10.  We consider the Free Software Foundation&#39;s suggestion that Microsoft open source Windows 7 and the fact that last month&#39;s was apparently NOT the last update of Windows 7 for all non-ESU users.  We look at the evolution of exploitation of the Remote Desktop Gateway flaw, Google&#39;s record breaking vulnerability bounty payouts, the return of Roskomnadzor, the size of fines, the question of who owns our biometrics, an update on Avast/AVG spying, the future of third-party AV, a major milestone for the WireGuard VPN, and the wonderful Little Red Wagon hack of the decade which titled this podcast.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-752.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-752.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-752-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

We look at the danger presented by a very popular GDPR-compliance add-in for WordPress sites.  We look at an eye-opening report about the stresses that CISOs are being subjected to, and also today&#39;s pilot test of Microsoft&#39;s new ElectionGuard voting system.

      <description>This week we reexamine the Windows 10 lost profiles problem, and also a consequence of the need to roll back (or avoid in the first place) the Patch Tuesday disaster.  We look at a new feature to arrive with the next Windows 10 feature release, unfortunately named the 2004 release.  We also examine the details of a new attack on the 4G LTE and 5G cellular technology, the full default rollout of Firefox&#39;s support for DoH, and also the availability of a powerful new sandboxing technology for Firefox.  We also check in with Chrome&#39;s fix earlier today of a zero-day that was found being exploited in the wild.  And, finally, before turning our attention to the bomb that Apple dropped in the lap of the entire certificate industry last week, I&#39;m going to update our listeners about the things I&#39;ve learned after returning to the work on SpinRite&#39;s next iteration.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-755.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-755.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-755-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we take a deep dive into the many repercussions preceding and following last week&#39;s Patch Tuesday.  Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to have a quiet one for a change?  But first, we look at a nice list of free services being maintained by BleepingComputer&#39;s Lawrence Abrams.  We look at a recent report into the state of open source software vulnerabilities, and at new and truly despicable legislation aimed at forcing social media companies to provide &#34;lawful access&#34; to their customers&#39; encrypted content.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-758.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-758.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-758-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

We take a deep dive into a very welcome forthcoming code security feature for Windows 10.  We share an action item for users of OpenWRT routers, and the result of an audit of Cloudflare&#39;s privacy-enforcing DNS service.

We have some browser news and another worrisome look into Android apps using a novel approach to quickly characterize them.  We have an interesting and sad bit of miscellany, a progress report on my SpinRite work, and then we take the sort of full technical deep dive into the joint Apple/Google Contact Tracing system that our listeners have come to expect from this podcast.

      <description>This week we update on the Apple/Google contact tracing technology.  We take a close look at the past week&#39;s frenzy over two newly disclosed vulnerabilities in iOS&#39;s mail application.  We consider the choice of VPN provider relative to expanding global surveillance agreements.  We look at some recently spotted dangers of public repositories.

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[This week we update on the Apple/Google contact tracing technology.  We take a close look at the past week's frenzy over two newly disclosed vulnerabilities in iOS's mail application.  We consider the choice of VPN provider relative to expanding global surveillance agreements.  We look at some recently spotted dangers of public repositories.  We share a bit of miscellany, a SpinRite update, and some useful feedback from a listener regarding Oracle's VirtualBox VM system.  We wrap up the week with a look into RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) for finally bringing some security to BGP, the Internet's critical Border Gateway Protocol.

      <description>This week we add Bruce Schneier&#39;s thoughts about the theoretical feasibility of contact tracing apps.  We touch on our government&#39;s feelings about DNS over HTTPS.  We look at yet another wacky way of exfiltrating data from an air-gapped computer.  We examine a new vulnerability that has already damaged some large high-profile enterprise infrastructures.  We note Adobe&#39;s latest round of critical updates, another welcome service coming from Mozilla, a dispiriting bit of over-the-top political correctness from the U.K., and Google&#39;s plans to clean up the mess which is the Chrome Web Store.  We share a bit of errata, miscellany, and SpinRite news, then take a look at China&#39;s proposed changes to the fundamental operation of our global Internet.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-765.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-765.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-765-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we examine Firefox&#39;s recent move to 76 and slightly beyond; a wonderful new feature coming to Edge; and the security responsibility that attends the use of WordPress, vBulletin, and other complex and sophisticated web applications. We look at the plans for this summer&#39;s much-anticipated Black Hat and DEF CON conferences, a newly revealed CRITICAL bug affecting all of the past six years of Samsung Smartphones, and Zoom&#39;s latest security-boosting acquisition.  I&#39;ll then provide an update on my SpinRite work which includes a bit of a rearrangement in sequence to provide another shorter term deliverable.

      <description>We begin this week as we often do on the third Tuesday with a look at the previous week&#39;s Patch Tuesday; and, in this case, a troubling new trend is emerging.  We look at the DoH support coming soon to Windows 10, and at a little known packet capture utility that was quietly added to Windows 10 with the October 2018 feature update.  We&#39;ll spend a bit of time on yesterday&#39;s DOJ/FBI press conference, and then take a look at a problem that Microsoft appears to be having a surprising time resolving.  We&#39;ll take a look at face masks thwarting automated public facial recognition, and Utah&#39;s decision to roll their own contact tracing and locating app.  And we&#39;ll wind up with what I hope will be an interesting walk through the history of Ethernet, from the beginning of wired to the evolution of the many confusing wireless protocols.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-767.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-767.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-767-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we begin with some browser news to examine a nifty new trick to be offered by the next Firefox 77, and spend a bunch of time on the many new features - and how to enable them - being offered in Chrome&#39;s 83rd edition.  We also look at Adobe&#39;s four emergency out-of-cycle patches, and a surprisingly robust and well designed new jailbreak for iPhones. We take a look at a surprisingly powerful DNS amplification attack with a packet count multiplier of up to 1,620, the sad but true complete collapse of Bluetooth connection security, and the odd report of eBay scanning their users&#39; PCs.  We share a bit of closing-the-loop listener feedback and a quick bit of miscellany, then I editorialize a bit about why I&#39;m very sure that contact tracking apps are dead on arrival.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-768.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-768.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-768-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

We note a few odd new and unwelcome behaviors from this year&#39;s 2004 Win10 feature update and dip into yet another side-channel attack on Intel chips.  But we also note that a long-awaited powerful antimalware technology is also about to ship from Intel.

      <description>This week we look at Microsoft&#39;s interesting decision to update Windows 7 desktops with their new Edge browser, Google&#39;s wholesale removal of 106 widely downloaded malicious Chrome extensions, Microsoft&#39;s continuing drama over Win10 printing, a potentially critical remote code execution vulnerability in everyone&#39;s favorite VLC media player, an interesting move by Roskomnadzor, Netgear&#39;s residence in the doghouse, a new and startling record in DDoS attack size, a bit of errata, and the anticipated announcement of a new piece of spin-off freeware from the SpinRite project.  Then we examine the ripple effects of the mass adoption of an embedded TCP/IP stack that is found to be horribly insecure many years after it has been quite widely adopted across the embedded device industry.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-772.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-772.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-772-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[This week we look at Microsoft's interesting decision to update Windows 7 desktops with their new Edge browser, Google's wholesale removal of 106 widely downloaded malicious Chrome extensions, Microsoft's continuing drama over Win10 printing, a potentially critical remote code execution vulnerability in everyone's favorite VLC media player, an interesting move by Roskomnadzor, Netgear's residence in the doghouse, a new and startling record in DDoS attack size, a bit of errata, and the anticipated announcement of a new piece of spin-off freeware from the SpinRite project.  Then we examine the ripple effects of the mass adoption of an embedded TCP/IP stack that is found to be horribly insecure many years after it has been quite widely adopted across the embedded device industry.

      <description>This week we look at news in the shortening of certificate lifetime change, at Apple&#39;s decision to deliberately ignore support for a bunch of new Web APIs, at Apple&#39;s announcement of DoH support, at some troubling Mozilla/Comcast news, at some welcome legislation to head off the use of facial recognition, and at another less welcome attempt to outlaw strong encryption.  We also look at the growing legislation against mandatory &#34;chipping&#34; and remind our listeners about the utility of VirusTotal.  Then, after catching up with a bit of miscellany and listener feedback, we revisit last week&#39;s very worrisome revelation of the many flaws in a very widely used embedded TCP/IP stack.

      <description>This week we look at two new just-released emergency Windows 10 updates, and the new and curious path they will need to take to get to their users.  We look at a slick new privacy feature coming to iOS 14 and how it is already cleaning up prior behavior.  We&#39;ll take our annual survey of the rapidly growing success of the HackerOne program, and also note the addition of a major new participant in their bug bounty management program.  We briefly note the latest American city to ban the use of facial recognition for law enforcement, but we mostly examine the result of NIST&#39;s analysis of demographic bias in facial recognition outcomes.  We&#39;ll also look at a high-velocity vulnerability and exploitation, and close the loop with a couple of listeners.  I&#39;ll share an interesting bit of work on SpinRite&#39;s AHCI controller benchmarking.

We touch on last week&#39;s Patch Tuesday, Cloudflare&#39;s surprise outage, another glitch in Zoom&#39;s product, and seven &#34;no-logging&#34; VPN providers whose logs were all found online.

We look into the fascinating details of a Russian attempt to co-opt and bribe an employee of Tesla, and at some sobering security research which successfully circumvents Visa&#39;s point-of-sale PIN protection, allowing purchases of any amount.  We also have a bunch of closing-the-loop feedback and miscellany.  Then we examine the surprising research into just how well knowing where our browser has gone in the past identifies who we are today.

Then we learn how much Vitamin D Dr. Fauci takes, and invite our podcast listeners to lock down their UserID of choice at GRC&#39;s new web forums using a non-public URL.

      <description>This week we examine the coming controversial changes to the WebExtensions API.  We look at the revelations and fallout from last week&#39;s Patch Tuesday, and at Zoom&#39;s latest announcement of this week&#39;s rollout of end-to-end encryption.  We make sure everyone knows about the latest horrific SonicWall vulnerability and Microsoft&#39;s pair of not-that-worrisome, out-of-cycle patches.  We share a bit of miscellany and closing-the-loop feedback.  Then we examine an actual Ryuk ransomware intrusion and attack, step-by-step.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-789.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-789.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-789-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

We look at the revelations and fallout from last week's Patch Tuesday, and at Zoom's latest announcement of this week's rollout of end-to-end encryption.  We make sure everyone knows about the latest horrific SonicWall vulnerability and Microsoft's pair of not-that-worrisome, out-of-cycle patches.  We share a bit of miscellany and closing-the-loop feedback.  Then we examine an actual Ryuk ransomware intrusion and attack, step-by-step.

      <description>This week we examine a recently patched zero-day in Chrome and a nice new feature in that browser.  We look at the site isolation coming soon to Firefox, and Microsoft&#39;s announcement of Edge for Linux.  We have some movement in the further deprecation of Internet Explorer, and a potentially massive SQL injection attack that was recently dodged by more than one million WordPress sites, despite the fact that some admins complained.  Then we have a bit of miscellany, closing-the-loop feedback, and an update on my work on SpinRite.  We end by looking at the NSA&#39;s recently published list of the top 25 network vulnerabilities being used by malicious Chinese state actors to attack U.S. assets.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-790.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-790.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-790-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we examine a serious newly revealed Windows zero-day flaw, a public service reminder from Microsoft, Google&#39;s newly announced plan to get into the VPN service business, CERT&#39;s unappealing plan for automatic vulnerability naming, and a real mess that WordPress just made of an incremental security update to 455 million sites.

      <description>This week the Chrome zero-days just keep on coming, and we contemplate what it means for the future.  We have two interesting bits of ransomware meta news including a new tactic.  We update after last week&#39;s Super Tuesday patch marathon, and examine new research into the most common source of Android malware to see where most unwanted apps come from  and it&#39;s not what we would likely guess.  We&#39;ll share a bit of listener feedback and an update on my work on SpinRite.  Then we look at the new &#34;SAD DNS&#34; attack which successfully regresses us 12 years in DNS cache poisoning and spoofing attack prevention.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-793.txt&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-793.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-793-notes.pdf&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>
