Then they FINALLY conclude what has become the three-part series describing the security of iOS v7.

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[(Part 3 of 3) On the heels of Apple's major update to their iOS Security whitepaper, Steve and Leo catch up with the week's top security news - one IMPORTANT Microsoft Zero-Day Fixit, but otherwise largely debunking a bunch of hysterical headlines and "news" stories.  Then they FINALLY conclude what has become the three-part series describing the security of iOS v7.  Unfortunately, this week the news is less good.
