EternalBlue is turning out to be far more &#34;eternal&#34; than we&#39;d wish.  Will Flash EVER die?  There&#39;s a new zero-day Flash exploit in the wild.

We ask, &#34;What is Google&#39;s Project Dragonfly?&#34;  We go over a highly effective and highly targeted ransomware campaign, present some closing-the-loop feedback from our listeners, and reveal a breakthrough in hacking/attacking WiFi passwords.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-675.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-675.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[This week we discuss yet another new and diabolical router hack and attack, Reddit's discovery of SMS 2FA failure, WannaCry refusing to die, law enforcement's ample unused forensic resources, a new and very clever BGP-based attack, Windows 10 update dissatisfaction, and Google advancing their state-sponsored attack notifications.  We ask, "What is Google's Project Dragonfly?"  We go over a highly effective and highly targeted ransomware campaign, present some closing-the-loop feedback from our listeners, and reveal a breakthrough in hacking/attacking WiFi passwords.

      <description>It&#39;s been another busy week.  We look at Firefox&#39;s changing certificate policies, the danger of grabbing a second-hand domain, the Fortnite mess on Android, another patch-it-now Apache Struts RCE, a frightening jump in Mirai Botnet capability, an unpatched Windows zero-day privilege elevation, and malware with a tricky new C&amp;C channel.  We find that A/V companies are predictably unhappy with Chrome, Tavis has found more serious problems in Ghostscript, and there&#39;s been a breakthrough in contactless RSA key extraction.  As if that weren&#39;t enough, we discuss a worrisome flaw that has always been present in OpenSSH, and problems with never-dying Hayes AT commands in Android devices.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-678.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-678.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week a widely used embedded OS (FreeRTOS) is in the doghouse, as are at least eight D-Link routers which have serious problems, most of which D-Link has stated will never be patched.  We look at five new problems in Drupal 7 and 8, two of which are rated critical; trouble with Live Networks RTSP streaming server; still more trouble with the now-infamous Windows 10 Build 1809 feature update; and a longstanding zero-day in the widely used and most popular plugin for jQuery.  We then discuss what can only be described as an embarrassing mistake in the open source libssh library, concluding by examining a fun recent hack and posing its solution to our audience as our Security Now! Puzzler of the Week.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-686.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-686.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

We also handle a bit of errata, some sci-fi miscellany, and a bit of closing-the-loop feedback from a listener.

      <description>This week we cover last month&#39;s Patch Tuesday this month.  We look at a GDPR-inspired lawsuit filed by Privacy International.  We ask our listeners to check two router ports to protect against a new botnet that&#39;s making the rounds.  We look at another irresponsibly disclosed zero-day, this time in VirtualBox.  We look at CloudFlare&#39;s release of a very cool 1.1.1.1 app for iOS and Android.  And, in perfect synchrony with this week&#39;s main topic, we note Microsoft&#39;s caution about the in-RAM vulnerabilities of the BitLocker whole-drive encryption. We also cover a bit of miscellany, we close the loop with our listeners, and then we take a deep dive into last week&#39;s worrisome revelation about the lack of true security being offered by today&#39;s Self-Encrypting SSD Drives.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-689.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-689.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>This week we cover the action during last week&#39;s Pwn2Own Mobile hacking contest.  As this year draws to a close, we delve into the final last word on processor misdesign.  We offer a very workable solution for unsupported Intel firmware upgrades for hostile environments.  We look at a forthcoming Firefox breach alert feature.  We cover the expected takeover of exposed Docker-offering servers.  We note the recently announced successor to recently ratified HTTP/2.  We cover a piece of 1.1.1.1 errata, close the loop with some of our podcast listeners, then finish by considering the future of passwords using a thoughtful article written by Troy Hunt, a well-known Internet security figure and the creator of the popular HaveIBeenPwned web service, among others.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-690.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-690.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>Hackers and attackers apparently enjoyed their Thanksgiving, since this week we have very little news to report.  But what we do have to discuss should be entertaining and engaging:  Yesterday the U.S. Supreme Court heard Apple&#39;s argument about why a class action lawsuit against their monopoly App Store should not be allowed to proceed; Google and Mozilla are looking to remove support for FTP from their browsers; and from our &#34;What could possibly go wrong?&#34; department we have browsers asking for explicit permission to leave their sandboxes.  We also have some interesting post-Troy Hunt &#34;Are Passwords Immortal?&#34; listener feedback from last week&#39;s topic.
