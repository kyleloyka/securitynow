      <description>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are occurring with ever-greater frequency every day. Although these damaging attacks are often used to extort high-profile gaming and gambling sites before major gambling events, attacks are also launched against individual users who do something to annoy &#34;zombie fleet masters&#34; while they are online.

      <description>Leo and I discuss the use of SSL and SSH encrypted tunneling for providing privacy and security whenever an insecure local network is being used - such as at an open WiFi hotspot or when using a hotel&#39;s network.  These solutions are not transparent and tend to be configuration intensive.  They also require the use of a &#34;server&#34; of some sort at the user&#39;s home or office.  This makes these approaches less suitable for casual users, but offers a solution for the more technically inclined road warriors.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-015.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-015.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>In our continuing exploration of VPN technology for protecting network users on networks they don&#39;t control, Leo and I discuss the oldest &#34;original&#34; VPN protocols: Industry standard IPSec, and Microsoft&#39;s own PPTP and L2TP/IPSec.  We examine and explain the trouble with interconnecting Windows machines to third-party VPN routers and examine the many reasons these older technologies are probably not optimal for on-the-go road warriors.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-017.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-017.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <description>On December 28th a serious new Windows vulnerability appeared and was immediately exploited by a growing number of malicious web sites to install malware.  Many worse viruses and worms are expected soon.  We start off discussing this, and our show notes provide a quick necessary workaround until Microsoft provides a patch.
