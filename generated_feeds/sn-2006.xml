      <description>Leo and I carefully examine the operation of the recently patched Windows MetaFile vulnerability.  I describe exactly how it works in an effort to explain why it doesn&#39;t have the feeling of another Microsoft &#34;coding error.&#34;  It has the feeling of something that Microsoft deliberately designed into Windows.  Given the nature of what it is, this would make it a remote code execution &#34;backdoor.&#34;  We will likely never know if this was the case, but the forensic evidence appears to be quite compelling.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-022.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-022.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

They explain how this lack of security enables a wide range of serious attacks to be perpetrated by any other machine sharing the same Ethernet - such as in a wireless hotspot, within a corporate network, or even in a wired hotel where the entire hotel is one big exploitable Ethernet LAN.

      <description>Steve and Leo briefly review last week&#39;s topic of symmetric stream ciphers, then pose the first Security Now! Puzzler/BrainTeaser which proposes a secure means for sending encrypted messages where neither party knows the other&#39;s key.  The Puzzler/BrainTeaser will be answered and resolved at the start of next week&#39;s episode.  Then, as always in their Q&amp;A episodes, they answer questions and discuss issues raised by listeners.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-032.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-032.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Steve and Leo briefly review last week's topic of symmetric stream ciphers, then pose the first Security Now! Puzzler/BrainTeaser which proposes a secure means for sending encrypted messages where neither party knows the other's key.  The Puzzler/BrainTeaser will be answered and resolved at the start of next week's episode.  Then, as always in their Q&A episodes, they answer questions and discuss issues raised by listeners.
