      <description>Leo and I catch up with the week&#39;s major security events.  We then examine the ecosystem of web page advertising by comparing it to other &#34;opportunistic advertising&#34; such as that appearing on public transportation, highway billboards, broadcast television commercials and other public venues - which consumers have no obligation to consume.  I eschew the implication that visitors to a web page have an obligation to retrieve third-party content, over which the website has little or no control, which consumes bandwidth, reduces online privacy, hinders performance, and potentially exposes visitors to malicious exploitation.  And I believe this remains true even when a visitor&#39;s retrieval of such despicable third-party content would generate much-needed revenue for the visited site.  Finally, I review the many operational features of uBlock Origin, my chosen HTML firewall, which effectively returns control to web users.&#xA;&#xA;Show notes:&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-523.pdf&#xA;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-523.txt&#xA;&#xA;Hosts: Steve Gibson &amp; Leo Laporte</description>
